## HomeBud
![HomeBud Logo](/src/assets/images/logo.png)

HomeBud is a simple Web App that I am working on, building on top of the basic Vue App framework.

It is going to be an application that will help people find lost pets, including things like data-driven insights on best practices for finding a pet within a given time of when they go missing, as well as a dedicated missing pet page that can track pet sightings and consolidate missing pet details.

I am building the front end with Vue.js, alongside with Vuetify as a front end framework.

The application's back end is a Node.JS REST API built with the Express framework.
