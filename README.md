## HomeBud
![HomeBud Logo](src/assets/images/logo.png)

HomeBud is a simple Web App that I am working on, building on top of the basic Vue App framework.

It is going to be an application that will help people find lost pets, including things like data-driven insights on best practices for finding a pet within a given time of when they go missing, as well as a dedicated missing pet page that can track pet sightings and consolidate missing pet details.

I am building the front end with Vue.js, alongside with Bulma as a CSS framework.

The application's back end will be built with Flask to manage all application data, and will include a REST API to provide the web UI with different services.

This is my first large project, so I am building it step by step, but most importantly, I am documenting my progress here.

I will be documenting everything from wireframes I used to design the front end, to diagrams I will make to lay out the design of my back end.


## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install
